## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The datasets are from Kaggle Seattle Airbnb Open Data in 2016. For this project, I am interested to understand that:

1. What are the available homes for rent across the calendar year?
2. What are the average rental prices for different months?
3. What are the obvious factors that could affect the rental price?
4. Are there any corrections between neighborhood and rental price?
5. How reviews and rental price correlate?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All the analysis are combined in one single notebook. The notebook is exploratory with titles and sections to showcase work relatd to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@caojinbo/being-smart-when-making-money-with-airbnb-787a7a6647a1).
